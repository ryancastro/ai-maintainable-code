# README.ai.md (Example)

This script fetches a Wikipedia article and summarizes it using an LLM. The current `summarize_text` function is a placeholder.

LLM Tools are expected to:

- Use `@ai:` comments to infer code structure
- Improve the summarization step
- Optionally suggest voice or video export as a next step

The goal is to demonstrate AI-maintainable code in action with minimal friction.
